# Complete Chapa Subscription Integration

**Date:** 2025-07-03

## Feature / Bug Fix Summary

This task is to complete the partial Chapa payment integration for premium subscriptions in the app. This includes implementing the full payment flow, from initiation to verification, and updating the user's premium status.

## Analysis

The current implementation is incomplete. The UI for the premium upgrade screen exists, but the payment flow is not fully implemented. The `chapasdk` is used, but the payment verification and user entitlement updates are missing.

I will start by researching the official Chapa documentation and the `chapasdk` package to understand the best practices for integration.

## Solution Implemented

*   **Dependency Update:** Update the `chapasdk` to version `^0.0.8+1`.
*   **UI Implementation:** Connect the "Upgrade to Premium" button to the payment flow.
*   **Payment Flow:**
    *   Generate a unique transaction reference (`tx_ref`).
    *   Initiate the payment using `Chapa.getInstance.startPayment()`.
    *   Handle the payment callbacks for success and failure.
    *   Verify the payment status using the Chapa API.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Update the user's premium status using a Riverpod provider.
    *   Persist the premium status locally using `SharedPreferences`.
*   **UI Feedback:**
    *   Show a loading indicator during payment processing.
    *   Display a success or failure message to the user.
    *   Update the UI to reflect the user's premium status.

## Files Created/Updated

*   `pubspec.yaml`: Updated `chapasdk` dependency.
*   `lib/screens/settings/premium_upgrade_screen.dart`: Implemented the payment flow.
*   `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`: Added logic to manage premium status.

## Caveats/Considerations

*   The Chapa API keys are stored in `lib/core/config/chapa_config.dart`. For a production app, these should be stored more securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secure vault).
*   The current implementation uses the Chapa test environment. The keys will need to be replaced with live keys for production.

## Next Steps or Follow-Ups

*   Implement webhook handling for more reliable payment verification.
*   Send receipt emails to users after successful payments.
