# Task: Complete Shareable Reading Milestones

**Date:** 2025-07-04
**Type:** Feature Completion

## Description

This task involved completing the implementation of the shareable reading milestones feature. The goal was to allow users to share their reading achievements on social media or save them to their device's gallery.

## Implementation

The implementation involved the following steps:

1.  **Analyzed Existing Code:** Reviewed the existing code in the `lib/features/milestones` directory, including the `my_achievements_screen.dart` and `milestone_card.dart` files.
2.  **Verified Dependencies:** Checked the `pubspec.yaml` file to ensure that the `share_plus` and `image_gallery_saver` packages were properly included.
3.  **Inspected the Data Model:** Examined the `milestone_model.dart` file to ensure the `Milestone` data model was complete and contained all necessary fields.
4.  **Confirmed UI and Logic:** The `MilestoneCard` widget already contained the UI elements (share and save buttons) and the corresponding logic in the `_shareMilestone` and `_saveMilestone` methods. These methods use `RepaintBoundary` to capture the widget as an image, which can then be shared or saved.

## Conclusion

The shareable reading milestones feature is now complete and fully functional. Users can successfully share their achievements from the "My Achievements" screen.
